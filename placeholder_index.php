			<div style="font-size: x-large">Welcome to PlanMYClasses Beta</div>
			<div>In a few days, you will have access to a simple application for planning your college schedule.  Not a day to day schedule, mind you, but your entire stay.</div>
			<div>After you've chosen your curriculum and extra classes you wish to take, you set the number of classes you wish to take each term and the application will plan out a schedule for you to follow.</div>
			<div>The resulting schedule will help you predict when you will graduate and when to expect tougher terms than others.  One of the features in progress will allow you to move classes within the schedule for more flexible planning.</div>
